#Update Submission:
The following information is required for the project update:

1. If you have lost a team member because that person has dropped the course, (or for any other reason) are you planning to make any design changes to your proposed project? If yes, describe the changes.
2. The status of the data: Is it usable for a machine-learning model in its current state?
3. A snapshot of the data, if you have it. For example, if you have downloaded your data as a table, you take a screenshot of the table and paste it into your document. This will vary depending on the project that you have chosen, contact me if you need clarifications.
4. What does your timeline look like now?
5. Are you planning to use any new algorithm for your project?

6* Along with these, for extra credits, you can zip and upload your current code with the submission. You may also send the link to your personal github or code repository that hosts your project code.
